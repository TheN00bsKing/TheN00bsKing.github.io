with the fact that you spend time
tryin to run

you think your just
the way you think you are
you sit at home
watching "mourning news"
picking channels to convey 
another deadly thought
you drink,you cry
and then you smoke alot

but honey
all we are 
is shadowed figures in the dark
all we say
lies between our eyes
indice me
and i will eat your head alive
