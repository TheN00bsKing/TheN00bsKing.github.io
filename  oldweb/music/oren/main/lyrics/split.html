מילים ולחן – אורן יעקובי

I thought I had the last from you
You must have been trying to get rid of me to

God, shut the doors one more time
I've had enough chills down my spine
Chills down my spine

Years have past, feelings would last
Dreams that not complete it's true
(Dreams that not complete it's true)
You must have been angry enough to fantasize to

God, shut the doors one more time
I've had enough chills down my spine
Chills down my spine

Paa paa paa paa paa….

If I could make it all disappear
My life would be a little bit more clear
Then I will not love you
'till the end of time in our play!

Good god, shut the doors one more time
I've had enough chills down my spine
Chills down my spine
